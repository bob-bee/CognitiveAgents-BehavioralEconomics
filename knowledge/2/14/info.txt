Summary:
The paper explores the impact of different decision-based reasoning agents (DbrAs) such as rational, chartist, and mimetic agents on cryptocurrency market dynamics. The study simulates the behaviors of these agents in an artificial bitcoin market and assesses their influence on cryptocurrency price prediction. The paper uses long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks for modeling the DbrAs' decision-making process and for predicting cryptocurrency prices. The study conducts various experiments to evaluate the performance of the DbrAs and concludes that rational agents, with the help of LSTM, are the most effective at predicting cryptocurrency market trends.
Discussion of Multi-Agent Systems:
Yes, the paper discusses the implementation and impact of multi-agent systems composed of different types of agents, including rational, chartist, and mimetic DbrAs.
Implementation of Multi-Agent Systems:
Yes, the paper implements a multi-agent system in which rational, chartist, and mimetic DbrAs interact within an artificial bitcoin market.
Programming Tools or Languages:
The paper does not specify the programming language or tools used to implement the multi-agent systems or the DbrAs. Therefore, this information is not available in the provided text.
Programming Approach:
The paper utilizes an LSTM neural network-based approach to model the reasoning processes of DbrAs and predict cryptocurrency prices. The LSTM model is trained using historical data and market indices to enable the agents to make decisions based on market trends.
Names of the Agents:
The paper discusses three types of decision-based reasoning agents: rational agents, chartist agents, and mimetic agents.
Discussion of Economics or Behavioral Economics:
Yes, the paper explores behavioral economics by examining the decision-making processes of the different agents and their influence on cryptocurrency markets.
Analysis of Economics Models:
The paper focuses on modeling the behaviors of agents and their impact on cryptocurrency market dynamics using LSTM-based models. It discusses the economic aspects of decision-making and its effects on market trends.
Approach to Development:
The paper uses a neural network-based approach, specifically LSTM, to model the decision-making processes of the DbrAs and their impact on the cryptocurrency market.
Discussion of Artificial Intelligence:
Yes, the paper discusses artificial intelligence through the use of LSTM neural networks to model the decision-making processes of agents and predict cryptocurrency prices.
Conclusions Drawn:
The paper concludes that rational DbrAs, utilizing LSTM models, provide the most accurate predictions for cryptocurrency market trends, closely aligning with real-world market dynamics.
Justification of Conclusions:
The conclusions are justified by comparing the predictions of the LSTM-based DbrAs models with actual market data. The study uses various metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions and determine which type of agent is most effective in predicting market trends.
