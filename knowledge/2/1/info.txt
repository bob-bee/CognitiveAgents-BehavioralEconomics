Summary of the paper:
The paper introduces a new model of investor cognitive behavior in the stock market. This model describes behavioral and cognitive attitudes of investors at the micro-level and explains their effects on decision-making. It uses a Multi-Agent Based Simulation (MABS) to validate the model, build an artificial stock market called SiSMar, and study the emergence of certain phenomena related to stock market dynamics at the macro-level. The artificial stock market consists of heterogeneous investor agents with a behavioral cognitive model, an intermediary agent, and a CentralMarket agent that matches buying and selling orders. The resulting simulator realistically simulates financial market operations and observes emergent socio-economic phenomena at the macro level.
Discussion of multi-agent systems:
Yes, the paper discusses multi-agent systems as it focuses on using a Multi-Agent Based Simulation (MABS) approach to model the stock market and the cognitive and behavioral behavior of investors.
Multi-agent systems implemented in the paper:
Yes, the paper implements multi-agent systems, particularly the artificial stock market called SiSMar, which is composed of heterogeneous investor agents with different behavioral and cognitive models, as well as an intermediary agent and the CentralMarket agent.
Programming tools or languages used:
The agents and the system are implemented using the MadKit platform and written in Java.
Programming approach taken:
The approach involves using distributed artificial intelligence techniques to implement the artificial stock market. The approach combines rational and cognitive mechanisms to simulate the stock market dynamics and observe emergent socio-economic phenomena at the macro level.
Names of the agents:
ExpertInvestor agents
NoviceInvestor agents
Intermediary agents
CentralMarket agent
Discussion of economics or behavioral economics:
Yes, the paper discusses economics, behavioral economics, and related disciplines such as behavioral finance, economic sociology, cognitive psychology, and financial economics.
Analysis of any models of economics:
Yes, the paper uses an integrative theoretical framework that includes concepts from various disciplines such as behavioral finance, economic sociology, cognitive psychology, and financial economics.
Approach used to develop:
The paper uses a Multi-Agent Based Simulation (MABS) approach to develop the model, using distributed artificial intelligence techniques and heterogeneous investor agents with cognitive and behavioral models.
Discussion of artificial intelligence:
Yes, the paper discusses the use of artificial intelligence, particularly distributed AI techniques, to model and simulate the artificial stock market.
Conclusions drawn from the paper:
The paper concludes that representing the micro-level led to building stock market dynamics and observing emergent socio-economic phenomena at the macro level. The results demonstrate that the behavioral cognitive model effectively influences the investor decision-making process and impacts market dynamics.
Justification of conclusions:
These conclusions are justified through the use of Multi-Agent Based Simulation (MABS), which allows the authors to simulate and observe the interactions of heterogeneous investor agents. Preliminary results support the effectiveness of the model in simulating realistic financial market operations and the emergence of socio-economic phenomena.
